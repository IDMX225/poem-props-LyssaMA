# IDMX 11ty Sass Starter

This starter is configured to watch and compile a simple Sass structure using 11ty. The code is located in the `src` folder, and the page is generated in the `public` folder. The `settings.json` in the `.vscode` folder configures LiveServer to serve from the `public` folder.

The build process includes minifying and autoprefixing styles via the `postbuild` script, which runs automatically after a `build`.

## Installation

**`npm install`**

> Run this command once to install the necessary node modules.

## Development Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Runs 11ty with hot reload at `localhost:8080`. It reloads on HTML or Sass changes.
  
- **`npm run build`**: Creates a production build with minified, autoprefixed CSS. Use this as the "Publish command" for hosting services like Netlify.
